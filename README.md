## Multilingual Support

This bot offers multilingual support, allowing users to choose the language in which they interact with the bot.

### How to change the language

The user can change the language using the `/setlanguage` command. Once set, the bot will use the chosen language for all future interactions.

Currently, the bot supports the following languages:

- **English** (`en`)
- **Portuguese** (`pt`)
- **Spanish** (`es`)
- **French** (`fr`)

If the user is already using the desired language, the bot will notify them that no change was made.

### Functionality

After setting the language, all the bot's messages and responses will be adjusted accordingly. This includes error messages, confirmations, and interaction commands such as `/status`, `/report`, and other administrator commands.

### How the translation works

Translations are managed using JSON files for each language (e.g., `en.json`, `pt.json`, `fr.json`). Each key corresponds to a message that the bot can send. The translation system is dynamic and can be easily expanded to support new languages.

If you would like to contribute improvements to the translations or add a new language, feel free to submit a pull request!
